# Vidlib - Explorer Based Video Management Application

### About this tool
This is work in progress tool written in Rust and ReactJS in order to view, track and manage video archives.
Using vidlib allows you to see, tag and view video files in explorer style. If you have a lot of video files such as myself, it becomes nightmare to know which videos you watched or not.

#### **It is still heavily WIP. Use it at your risk.**
